# ReactNativeRecipes
Playing with React Native to build a simple recipes app

# Zero to hero

## Running the app locally
* `npm install`
* `npm run start`

## Releasing
To be confirmed:
* After initial release, `expo publish` should suffice for most releases of just JS changes
* Otherwise `expo build:android` and roll out a release through [Google Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish)

## Tests
* `npm run test`
